Description: Package has 3 functions; product_of_others,
             missing_NOs, is_perm_palindrome.
             product_of_others function multiplies all of the 
             elements in vector except the element that you want and 
             writes the multiplication result.
             missing_NOs function  looks for 2 missing numbers 
             in given script from 1 to 100.
             is_perm_palindrome function checks given string is 
             palindrome or not by checking 1 element from back 
             and 1 element from beginning. If they are same, function 
             writes "it is not a palindrome". If they are not same, 
             function checks every element until string is  done. 
             If string is palindrome, function writes "it is a 
             palindrome"
